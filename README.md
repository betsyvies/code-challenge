# Welcome Gists Blog

Gists Blog is a website where you can search for different technological topics, code of different programming languages. I sure that you will enjoy it. 

Happy learning and coding!!!

## Getting started

- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Development server: `yarn start`
- Run tests: `yarn test`

## Questions

What are your thoughts around continuous integration, where & how you would deploy this application?

- I think it is a good way to develop and give our users the changes available.
For example, if our users want a car to go to work, giving them the car in parts will not help their purpose. But, if you give them a skateboard, a bicycle, a motorcycle, and other things that help them get to work. They would be very happy.
I would deploy in AWS or Heroku, both are good tools for CI (Continuous Integration).
 
What do you think you would do differently if you had 2 weeks to complete this assignment and no requirement to use Github.

- I would love to finish with the functionality of all the views, making the test code, adding alerts or warnings, I would also like to create a comment sections for the posts

What would your backend solution look like?

- I would like to add a final point of comments for the posts. It will be interesting to read other logics and learn from them. I think it can be done with firebase easily, to see if it is scalable

How and where do you feel like this application should be deployed to?

- It should be deployed in a cloud computing, such as AWS, Salesforce, and others. This because is on-demand, the pay is for use, and the scope is global. As the project is on-test

Are you happy with your own solutions? If yes, which parts do you think are really well done, if not, what would you want to change?

- Yes, I am happy, because I have made progress in a short time with many solutions. I have read documentation that I had never read before with the GitHub API. The part I like the most is the SCSS part, usually it's what I find the hardest, but now I really liked it. On the other hand, I would like to add the registered user part
